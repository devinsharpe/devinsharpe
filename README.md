# Hello! 👋🏽 I'm Devin Sharpe

I'm a full stack web developer who is passionate about connecting users with good software and new experiences. I'm always excited to jump into a new codebase or design file and start on building out those experiences. I love seeing new features go from being standup ideas to valuable experiences for users. I currently work with Typescript, React, and NextJS for most of my professional and personal projects. Feel free to look around and explore some of my repositories, projects, and scraped ideas.

## Top Projects

### 🌸 Ikigai

I started to become exhausted with managing my life and obligations with multiple apps, so I decided to explore creating a task and time management application. Ikigai allows users to manage life's many projects by logging time entries, create tasks, and collaborate with other team members. I took this opportunity to experiment with new technologies as well, such as, Vercel's edge functions and Meta AI's LLaMA 2 model.

### 🐦 Birb - Simple Social

I undertook the development of a modern social media PWA with the aim of fostering genuine connections among individuals in a simpler and healthier manner. This platform allows users to freely share three text posts and one image per day, alleviating the burdens of projecting an artificially perfect online image. The project involved managing multiple databases, maintaining multiple apps within a monorepo, and engaging in cutting-edge experimentation at the edge, offering me the exhilarating learning experience I constantly seek.
