# Hello! 👋🏽 I'm Devin Sharpe

I'm a full stack web developer who is passionate about connecting users with good software and new experiences. I'm always excited to jump into a new codebase or design file and start on building out those experiences. I love seeing new features go from being standup ideas to valuable experiences for users. I currently work with Typescript, React, and NextJS for most of my professional and personal projects. Feel free to look around and explore some of my repositories, projects, and scraped ideas.
